      <h4>
        Dolphins are highly intelligent marine mammals and are part of the
        family of toothed whales that includes orcas and pilot whales.
      </h4>
      <p>
        They are found worldwide, mostly in shallow seas of the continental
        shelves, and are carnivores, mostly eating fish and squid. Dolphin
        coloration varies, but they are generally gray in color with darker
        backs than the rest of their bodies. As climate change causes the seas
        and oceans to warm, dolphins are being seen more frequently in colder
        waters outside their historic ranges. Due to rapidly rising ocean
        temperatures, dolphins’ primary food sources are seeking deeper, cooler
        waters. Scientists are concerned that dolphins will have difficulty
        adapting as quickly as necessary to find new feeding grounds to sustain
        their populations. Some dolphins that live in areas where rivers and
        oceans meet, known as brackish waters, are also losing habitat as ocean
        levels rise due to global warming.
      </p>
      <h3>5 Facts About Dolphins</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          As mammals, dolphins are warm-blooded. Unlike fish, who breathe
          through gills, dolphins breathe air using lungs. As a result, they
          must make frequent trips to the surface of the water to breathe.
        </li>
        <li>
          Dolphins find prey by using echolocation, and they also use whistles,
          clicks and squeaks to communicate.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bottlenose dolphins frequently ride the bow-waves of ships and
          body-surf on breaking waves.
        </li>
        <li>
          The common dolphin is highly active and acrobatic, and is among the
          fastest swimmers of all cetaceans, with a top speed of about 25 mph.
        </li>
        <li>
          Despite its name, the killer whale, also known as the orca, is the
          largest member of the dolphin family.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <br />
      <h4>Defenders' Impact</h4>
      <p>
        Defenders fights any attempt to weaken the Marine Mammal Protection Act
        and all the protections it affords marine mammals like dolphins.
      </p>
      <p>
        Defenders serves as a conservation member of the Bottlenose Dolphin Take
        Reduction Team, a stakeholder group convened under the MMPA to advise
        the National Marine Fisheries Service on how to reduce fisheries bycatch
        of this species. We are currently litigating to challenge seismic
        blasting in the Atlantic Ocean that risks harming and killing thousands
        of dolphins.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are also opposing offshore oil and gas development in the Arctic and
        Atlantic, and working to promote wildlife- and whale-friendly best
        management practices for offshore wind siting and development.

      <h2 class="row justify-content-center">Habitat</h2>

      <br />
      <p>
        Dolphins have a worldwide distribution, as they inhabit all the oceans
        and seas of the world except the Caspian Sea and the Aral Sea. Most
        species are concentrated in temperate and tropical areas although they
        dwell from the equator to the subpolar regions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Obviously, the distribution and habitat are different for each dolphin
        species, but usually, they avoid extreme cold waters, so they are not
        found in the polar zones.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dolphins are found living in bodies of water around the world. They
        inhabit all of the oceans and some important rivers. Most of them live
        in saltwater, but a few species thrive in freshwater.
      </p>
      <p>
        The habitat of dolphins varies according to environmental factors and
        food accessibility. They are smart creatures with the intelligence to
        modify their habitat when needed for survival.

      <h4>
        There are many factors that lead endager of dolphins but we can
        contribute to keep out seas clean
      </h4>
      <h5>Here are some of the mindful things we can do on our end</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Reduce - Reuse – Recycle - Rethink - Respond; bring your reusable
          grocery totes, If you must buy disposables. ..buy paper products
          rather than plastic or Styrofoam. The manufacture of Styrofoam
          depletes the ozone layer.
        </li>
        <li>Conserve water, waste not and fix leaks.</li>
        <li>
          Use fewer harmful chemicals and pollutants, and dispose of them
          properly
        </li>
        <li>Try to use phosphate-free laundry and dish soaps.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I believe we can help dolphins and other marine animals to survive in
        the sea by being mindful of what we throw to the sea. <br />
        Althought, we can do only so much. There are a lot of organizations that
        dedicate themselves to saving dolphins. <br />
        One of these organizations is called "Support Dolphin Project"
      </p>
